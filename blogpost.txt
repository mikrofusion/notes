"If you live in the JavaScript world long enough, eventually you or someone you love will be effected by callback hell." - Mike Groseclose

Part1:  Background
Javascript treats functions as first class citizens, which means that functions can now be treated like any other variables.  

Having first-class functions allows for higher order function


Javascript applications are single threaded.


Synchronous vs Asynchronous Programing


When javascript code block is running, there is no other code is being ran.
Events are asynchronous.  (click events, network responses, etc)

Named Methods

Promises

hash = { one: 1, two: 2, three: 3}
for var number in [1, 2, 3] {
    for item in hash {
           if item = number {
                     push result, item
                          }
                            }
                              
}
